# Webpages
This is the collection of the webpages that I build during my stay at IITK. Improving with every attempt, trying out templates, non-templates and various other features.

*This webpage isn't made with the help of any template, except for a jquery template for the count-up feature*

**This homepage is available [here](https://home.iitk.ac.in/~parinayc20/)**
